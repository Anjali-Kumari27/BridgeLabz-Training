# BridgeLabz-Training
## Week 5: Collection Framework

### Day 27: Fundamentals of Java Generics 
**Date:** 16-Jan-2026

1. Created and organized the `java-collections-practice` branch for structured Java Collections.
2. Set up a clean project structure to separate practice areas.

### Project Structure

```

3. Studied the basics of **Java Generics**.
4. Learned Java Generics for type-safe and reusable collection handling.
5. Understood Type Parameters (T, E, K, V) and their role in APIs.
6. Implemented Generic Classes and Generic Methods.
7. Used Bounded Types (extends, super) to restrict and control types.
8. Applied Wildcards (?, ? extends, ? super) for flexible collections.
9. Followed Generics best practices (no raw types, safe bounds, readable design)

### Day 28: Java Collection Framework 
**Date:** 17-Jan-2026
1. Studied Java Collections Framework architecture and hierarchy.
2. Understood the role of Collection and Map interfaces.
3. Learned List Interface and its implementations:
 - ArrayList
 - LinkedList
 - Vector
4. Performed common List operations:
- `Add`, `remove`, `update`, `search`
5. Iteration using for-each, Iterator, and ListIterator
6. Learned Set Interface and its implementations:
 - HashSet
 - LinkedHashSet
 - TreeSet
7. Understood uniqueness, ordering, and sorting behavior in Sets.
8. Learned Map Interface and its implementations:
 - HashMap
 - LinkedHashMap
 - TreeMap
9. Performed key-value operations:
 - Insertion, deletion, retrieval
10. Iteration using entrySet(), keySet(), and values()
11. Learned Queue Interface and its implementations:
 - PriorityQueue
 - ArrayDeque
12. Studied queue operations:
 - Enqueue, dequeue, peek & poll
13. Understood FIFO behavior and priority-based processing.
14. Understood internal working, use cases, and performance considerations.
15. Practiced real-time examples for List, Set, Queue and Map.
16. Committed and pushed all work.

## Week 5: Practicing and Learning about Java Collection Framework

### Day 28: Java Streams
**Date:** 19-Jan-2026

1. Studied Java I/O Streams architecture and stream-based data handling.
2. Covered Byte Streams and Character Streams for file operations.
3. Learned and implemented:
- `FileInputStream`, `FileOutputStream`
- `FileReader`, `FileWriter`
- `BufferedInputStream`, `BufferedOutputStream`
- `BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter`
4. Understood Object Streams:
- `ObjectInputStream`, `ObjectOutputStream`
- `Serialization` and `deserialization`
5. Practiced in-memory streams:
- `ByteArrayInputStream`, `ByteArrayOutputStream`
6. Used bridge streams:
- `InputStreamReader`, `OutputStreamWriter`
7. Applied try-with-resources, buffering, and performance best practices.
8. Solved practical problems including `file copy`, `serialization`, and efficient large-file reading.
9. Committed and pushed all work.
