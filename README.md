## Week 7: Java 8 Features

### Day 35: Lambda Expressions, Method References & Interfaces
**Date:** 27-Jan-2026

1. Set up and revised the java8-programming-practice branch structure.
```
BridgeLabz-Training/
│── java8-programming-practice/
│ 	│── gcr-codebase/
|   |   └── Java8Concepts/
|   |       └── src/

|   |               ├── methodrefrence/
|   |
│ 	└── scenario-based/
└── README.md
```
2. Studied Java 8 goals and functional-programming concepts.
3. Learned lambda expression syntax and target typing.
4. Implemented custom and predefined functional interfaces (`Predicate`, `Function`, `Consumer`, `Supplier`).
5. Practiced method references:
   - Static, and instance forms
   - Constructor references  
7. Applied Java-8 best practices.
8. Solved practice problems and committed all work.
