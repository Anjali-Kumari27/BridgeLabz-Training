## Week 3: Building Core OOP Concepts in Java 

## Day 12 : Java Keywords – `static`, `this`, `final` & `instanceof`
**Date:** 29-Dec-2025

1. Learned the use of the `static` keyword to understand :
  - How shared variables and methods can be shared across all objects of a class
  - Reduced memory usage and avoided redundancy
  - Avoid unnecessary object-level duplication
2. Practiced the `this` keyword:
  - Used to resolve ambiguity between instance variables and constructor parameters
  - Improved clarity during object initialization
3. Understood the importance of `final` keyword :
  - Used `final` variables for identifiers like IDs, account numbers, ISBNs, etc.
  - Ensured values remain unchanged once assigned
4. Learned and applied `instanceof` operator:
  - Performed safe type checking at runtime
  - Prevented runtime errors during object handling
5. Implemented multiple real-world Java programs to apply these concepts:
6. Focused on writing structured, readable, and reusable code following OOP best practices.
7. Committed and pushed all the programs to the repository.

## Day 13 : Object Modeling and Class Diagram
**Date:** 30-Dec-2025

1. Understood the difference between `Class` and `Objects`:
   - `Class` as a blueprint defining structure and behavior
   - `Object` as a real instance holding actual data
2. Learned how memory allocation works for classes and objects:
   - Class loaded in JVM
   - Objects created in heap memory
3. Studied how objects represent real-world entities with unique state and shared behavior.
4. Studied **object relationships**:
   - `Association`
   - `Aggregation`
   - `Composition`
   - `Communication`
5. Learned how objects communicate using method calls.
6. Learned **UML diagrams**:
   - `Class diagrams` to represent structure and relationships
   - `Sequence diagrams` to understand interaction flow between objects
7. Committed and pushed all updates to the repository.

## Day 14 : Inheritance
**Date:** 31-Dec-2025

1. Learned the concept of `inheritance` to promote code reusability and hierarchy.
2. Studied different types of inheritance:
   - `Single-level` inheritance
   - `Multilevel` inheritance
   - `Hierarchical` inheritance
3. Understood key features of inheritance such as:
   - Code reuse
   - Method overriding
   - Runtime polymorphism
4. Practiced `method overriding` to modify parent class behavior in child classes.
5. Learned how **constructors behave in inheritance** and how parent constructors are invoked.
6. Explored the relationship between `polymorphism` and `inheritance`.
7. Studied the role of `access modifiers` in inheritance and their visibility rules.
8. Implemented programs to demonstrate inheritance concepts.
9. Committed and pushed all updates to the repository.

## Day 15 : Encapsulation , Polymorphism , Abstraction & Interface
**Date:** 01-Jan-2026

1. Learned `Encapsulation` which shows
   - how to protect data using private variables and public methods.
2. Practiced `Polymorphism` which shows
   - how to achieve flexibility through method overriding and dynamic method dispatch.
3. Studied **Abstract Classes** to define common behavior while allowing partial implementation.
4. Learned `Interfaces` to achieve full abstraction and support multiple inheritance in Java.
5. Understood **upcasting and downcasting**:
   - Upcasting for generalization and runtime polymorphism
   - Downcasting for accessing child-specific behavior safely
6. Implemented programs demonstrating `abstraction` and `polymorphism` using interfaces and abstract classes.
7. Focused on writing clean, modular, and maintainable OOP-based code.
8. Committed and pushed all updates to the repository.
