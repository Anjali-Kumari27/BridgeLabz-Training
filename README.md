## Week 7: Java Design Principles & Design Patterns

### Day 39: Design Principles & Design Patterns
**Date:** 31-Jan-2026

1. Set up and revised the `java-design-pattern-practice` branch structure.
```
BridgeLabz-Training/
│── java-design-pattern-practice/
│ 	│── gcr-codebase/
|   |   └── DesignPatternPractice/

└── README.md
```
2. Studied SOLID and additional design Principles such that :
   - DRY, KISS, YAGNI
   - SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
   - OCP (Open closed Principle)
   - LSP (Liscov Substitution Principle)
   - ISP (Interface Segregation)
   - DIP (Dependency Inversion)
   - Programming to interfaces
   - Favor composition over inheritance
3. Studied GoF design patterns overview :
   - Creational, Structural, Behavioral categories
4. Implemented core patterns:
   - Singleton
   - Factory
   - Observer
   - Builder
5. Analyzed UML diagrams and real-world analogies for patterns.
6. Solved pattern-based questions and mini design problems.
7. Committed and pushed all work.

## Week 8: Multithreading

### Day 40: Multithrading in Java
**Date:** 02-Feb-2026

1. Studied process vs thread concepts and multithreading benefits and drawbacks.
2. Learned Java thread lifecycle:
   - NEW, RUNNABLE, BLOCKED, WAITING, TIMED_WAITING&TERMINATED`
3. Created threads using:
   - Extending Thread
   - Implementing Runnable
4. Practiced core Thread methods:
   - start(), sleep(), join(), yield(), isAlive()
5. Worked with thread priorities, daemon threads, and interruption handling.
6. Implemented synchronization for shared database resources.
7. Compared single-threaded vs multi-threaded payroll insertion performance.
8. Solved use cases involving:
   - Parallel employee inserts
   - Salary updates using threads
9. DB consistency checks with JUnit
10. Logged execution timing and validated results using test cases.
11. Committed and pushed all work.
