```
2. Studied Java 8 goals and functional-programming concepts.
3. Learned lambda expression syntax and target typing.
4. Implemented custom and predefined functional interfaces (`Predicate`, `Function`, `Consumer`, `Supplier`).
5. Practiced method references:
   - Static, and instance forms
   - Constructor references  
7. Applied Java-8 best practices.
8. Solved practice problems and committed all work.

### Day 36: Interfaces (Functional, Marker and static Default methods)
**Date:** 28-Jan-2026

1. Implemented different types of interfaces in Java.
2. Worked with **Marker Interfaces** for tagging and conditional behavior.
3. Used **Static methods in interfaces** for utility-style functionality.
4. Implemented **Default methods** to provide common behavior across classes.
5. Created and used **Functional Interfaces** for lambda expression support.
6. Practiced real-world Problems.
7. Committed and pushed all solutions.

### Day 37: Stream API (Java 8)
**Date:** 29-Jan-2026

1. Studied Java 8 Stream API for functional-style data processing.
2. Practiced **intermediate operations**: `filter`, `map`, `flatMap`, `distinct`, `sorted`, `peek`, `limit`, `skip`.
3. Used **terminal operations**: `collect`, `forEach`, `reduce`, `count`, `anyMatch`, `allMatch`, `noneMatch`.
4. Understood **stateless vs stateful operations**  
  (e.g., `filter` – stateless; `sorted`, `distinct` – stateful).
5. Learned differences between **ordered and unordered streams**.
6. Worked with **parallel streams** and their behavior.
7. Compared `forEach()` in **Iterable vs Stream** context.
8. Implemented real world questions and committed all code.

### Day 38: Collectors 
**Date:** 30-Jan-2026

### Collectors (Java 8)

1. Studied **Collectors** used with `Stream.collect()` for data aggregation.
2. Learned roles of collectors: **transforming, aggregating, grouping, and partitioning data**.
3. Practiced commonly used collectors: `toList()`, `toSet()`, `toMap()`, `joining()`.
4. Implemented `groupingBy()` and `partitioningBy()` for classification logic.
5. Used `summarizingInt()` to generate statistical summaries.
6. Solved real-world scenarios using Streams and Collectors.
7. Committed and pushed all solutions
