# BridgeLabz-Training
## Week 3: DSA Fundamentals

### Day 16: Introduction to Data Structures & Algorithms  
**Date:** 02-Jan-2026

1. Created and organized the `dsa-practice` branch for structured DSA learning.
2. Set up a clean project structure to separate practice areas.

### Project Structure
```BridgeLabz-Training/
BridgeLabz-Training/
│── dsa-practice/
│ 	│── gcr-codebase/
│ 	│── leetcode-codebase/
│ 	│── scenario-based/
│── README.md
```
3. Studied the basics of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.
4. Learned Linked List fundamentals, including:
   - `Singly Linked List`
   - `Doubly Linked List`
   - `Circular Linked List`
5. Solved basic problems based on linked list operations.
6. Committed and pushed all changes to GitHub.
