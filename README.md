# BridgeLabz-Training
This repository contains my daily learning progress during BridgeLabz training, organized into separate branches for better structure and clarity.

Each branch focuses on a specific phase of learning:
- Core Java fundamentals
- Java Object-Oriented Programming
- Data Structures & Algorithms

## Week 1 & Week 2: Core Java Programming

Branch: `core-java-practice`
Topics Covered:
- Git & GitHub basics
- Java programming fundamentals
- Variables, data types, operators
- Control flow statements
- Arrays & strings
- Methods & code reusability
- Exception handling
- LeetCode practice 
- Scenario-based problems

## Week 2 & Week 3: Java Object-Oriented Programming

Branch: `java-oops-practice`
Topics Covered:
- Classes & objects
- Constructors & access modifiers
- Java keywords (static, this, final, instanceof)
- Object modeling & UML diagrams
- Inheritance & polymorphism
- Encapsulation & abstraction
- Interfaces & casting
- Scenario-based OOP applications

## Week 3: Data Structures & Algorithms

Branch: `dsa-practice`
Topics Covered:
- DSA fundamentals
- Linked lists (singly, doubly, circular)
- Stack & queue
- HashMap & hashing
- Implementation-based problem solving

Notes
1.Each branch contains its own detailed README with day-wise learning logs
2. The main branch README acts as a central overview
3. Repository is updated continuously as training progresses


🎓 Learnings & Best Practices
- Code Organization: Following industrial standards
- Naming Conventions: Camel case, Pascal case and meaningful names
- Version Control: Regular commits with descriptive messages
